# Background {background-color="#107895"}
## Background

* Formally trained as a statistician, Newcastle University
    * MMathStat, Mathematics and Statistics (1st)
    * PhD in Statistics

. . .

* Always had an interest in "Computer Science"

. . .

* Discovered a career path that incorporates best of both worlds,
  **Data Science**


# Portfolio {background-color="#107895"}

# Advanced Laryngeal Cancer {background-color="#107895"}
## Advanced Laryngeal Cancer

Approached by Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

The pseudonymised dataset contained:

1. survival times (date of diagnosis, death and last check-up)

1. clinical variables (age, smoking status, AJCC tumour status)

1. CT scan output (radiomic data), for a subset of patients

---

### Scope

Objectives were clear from the offset.

* Quantify impact of clinical predictors on survival times

* Delineate which radiomic features impact survival times

* Assess model improvement when CT data is available

* Publish results in scientific journal [^1]

[^1]: Ongoing, currently with *"The Journal of Laryngology and Otology"*.

---

### Approach and Deliverables

Right-censored data, too many radiomic predictors. \
**Penalised Cox regression**, specifically LASSO.

::: aside
10-fold Cross-validation was used to choose a penalty parameter value.

### Scope

Investigate environmental health of English housing.

Key questions:

1. Are current metrics (EPC, SAP rating) suitable indicators?

2. Is dwelling efficiency impacted by region within the UK?

Open-source datasets considered: English housing survey (EHS), local authority
housing data, and local authority emissions data.

---

### Approach

Intention was always to keep models simple.

### **Model A**

* Linear regression on efficiency or CO2 rating from EPC
* Regressed on key factors like boiler, insulation and more

### **Model B**

* Linear mixed effects model, intercept only
* Models overall mean and region-specific effect

---

### Deliverables

Presented key results to industry partners in May 2022.

Full report and source code available on GitHub.

# Modelling Hydrocarbon Concentrations in Groundwater Monitoring Networks {background-color="#107895"}
## Modelling Hydrocarbon Concentrations in Groundwater Monitoring Networks

PhD studentship supported by Shell who:

* partially funded research

* provided groundwater monitoring data, specifically hydrocarbon
  concentrations (subject to NDA)
  
* communicated suggestions via monthly update meetings

---

### Data

Measurements require extracting sample, transport elsewhere.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%" style="line-height:150%"}
* **Spatiotemporal** \
  Sampled annually to quarterly at pre-built "wells"
* **Environmental** \
  High degree of left-censoring
* **Complex** \
  Different geological, chemical, and political considerations

### Scope

Two variable "types" arising from shown data generating process:

1. **Analyte**

    * hydrocarbon concentration to be minimised
    * benzene (carcinogenic), toluene, ethylbenzene and more
    
1. **Predictor**

    * also available and easier data collection
    * temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ORP

---

Our intentions were then to

* (*Optimistic*) describe an underlying relationship between analytes
  and predictors
  
* (*Realistic*) predict hydrocarbon concentrations using predictors,
  potentially with telemetry.

> Deeper insight into hydrocarbon concentrations using data analysis on
> already existing data to increase financial feasiblity.

---

### Approach

A lot of statistical models under supervisor guidance.

* Multiple and multivariate regression [^2]

* Tobit regression

* Matrix normal regression

* Mixture of experts

* Varying intercept, spatial prior

[^2]: 
  Dependent variable censored values replaced with half detection limit.

---

### Deliverables

* Very little signal in the data compared to noise

* Aiming to have a letter to the editor, describing findings

* Models to become open source [^bmoe-gh], potentially CRAN packages

* More research needed for other water quality variables, say iron

* Advised Shell against exploring telemetry with these predictors
